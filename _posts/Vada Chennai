Vada Chennai is a gangster based movie which was in making for some span. We have been reading about it for sometime. 
From a performer like Dhanush and a master director like Vetrimaaran, we would expect a “Masterpiece”. Movie was made on a budget of 80 CR.
Let’s check whether they have met our expectations.

### Plot
Movie follows a non-linear pattern which revolves around certain timeline, covers almost main events in TamilNadu Politics.
A Gangster movie which has maintained the class can definitely be compared with Anurag Kashyap’s  “Gangs of Wasseypur”. 
Anbu’s life in prison and the gangwar inside prison is well depicted. The jail like outside world has its own gang and gangleaders. 
Sheer violence and local (abusive )languages has been used to showcase reality. 
Smuggling and fistfights which highlights spine chilling jail life also gives thrills to audience. Like MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), 
Director Vetrimaaran was able to create a space with his “real” characters in Tamil Cinema. Pollathavan,Visaranai and Aadukalam got a much superior successor in Vada Chennai. Will love to see 2nd and 3rd installaments of the movie.

### Performances

Dhanush as Anbu has given his lifetime best performance. Among Tamil Actors only he can do such a role which portrays life in North Chennai and in jail.
Vetrimaaran as Director has used all his experience in making this legendary movie.
Samuthirakani as Guna has given convincing performance.
Ameer will have more to do in 2nd part which will be released soon.
### Final Cut
I loved this movie which is rare to be witnessed in Indian film industry. One of the best tamil movie in current decade which patches well with reality. I would say it’s a “Masterpiece” and lifetime best movie of Vetrimaaran till date. Go for it.

4.5/5
